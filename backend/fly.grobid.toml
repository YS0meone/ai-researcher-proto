# fly.toml for GROBID server — deployed as a separate Fly app.
# No public endpoint — accessed internally by ai-researcher-worker via:
#   http://ai-researcher-grobid.internal:8070

primary_region = 'iad'

[build]
  image = 'grobid/grobid:0.8.2-crf'

# No [http_service] — internal-only via Fly private network (6PN).
# Fly-proxy is not involved; the worker reaches GROBID directly at .internal DNS.
